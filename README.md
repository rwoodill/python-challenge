Background
It's time to put away the Excel sheet and enter the world of programming with Python. In this assignment, you'll use the concepts you've learned to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. Both tasks present a real-world situation where your newly developed Python scripting skills come in handy.

Hints and Considerations
Consider what you've learned so far. You've learned how to import modules like csv. You’ve learned how to read and write files in various formats. You’ve learned how to store content in variables, lists, and dictionaries. You’ve learned how to iterate through basic data structures. And you’ve learned how to debug along the way. Using all that you've learned, try to break down your tasks into discrete mini-objectives.

The datasets for these Challenges are quite large. This was done purposefully to showcase one of the limits of Excel-based analysis. As data analysts, our first instinct is often to go straight to Excel, but creating scripts in Python can provide us with more powerful options for handling big data.

Write one script for each of the provided datasets. Run each script separately to make sure that the code works for its respective dataset.

Always commit your work and back it up with pushes to GitHub or GitLab. You don't want to lose hours of your hard work! Also make sure that your repo has a detailed README.md file.
